In countries where a right to reverse engineer is provided by law unless information is available about the Software in order to achieve interoperability, functional compatibility or other objectives, you agree to submit a detailed written proposal to COMPANY concerning your need for such information before engaging in reverse engineering (or requesting or purporting to authorize any other person or entity to do so) and COMPANY may, in its sole discretion, propose to you terms and conditions under which it is willing to make such information available.

You may not combine or distribute the Software or any derivative work thereof with Open Source Software (as defined below) or with software developed using Open Source Software (e.g., tools) in a manner that subjects COMPANY or its licensors or any portion of the Software provided by COMPANY or its licensors hereunder or any derivative work thereof to any license obligations of such Open Source Software.

9. MISCELLANEOUS. 

9.1 Assignment. 
You may not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of COMPANY. Any such assignment without the prior express written consent of COMPANY shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.2 Governing Law and Venue. 
This Agreement shall be governed, construed, interpreted, enforce and litigated by, and the relations between the parties shall be determined in accordance with, the laws of Gibraltar, excluding conflict of laws and provisions. This Agreement, which is in English, shall be interpreted in accordance with the commonly understood meaning of the words and phrases in Gibraltar.

9.3 Dispute Resolution. 
(a) You agree that any controversy or claim between COMPANY and you arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any agreements or instruments relating hereto or delivered in connection herewith, including, but not limited to, a claim based on or arising from an alleged tort, will, at the request of any party, be determined by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC"), as follows:

(i) The arbitration will be administered by ICC International Court of Arbitration pursuant to its Rules of Arbitration. At the beginning of the Arbitration, ICC will be instructed by either or both parties to prepare a list of proposed arbitrators. Within 10 days of receipt of the list, each party may strike one name from the list. The ICC will then appoint one arbitrator from the name(s) remaining on the list. The arbitrator will give effect to statutes of limitation in determining any claim. Any controversy concerning whether an issue is arbitrable will be determined by the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator will set forth findings of the facts and conclusions of law. A failure by the arbitrator to make findings of fact and conclusions of law will not be grounds for overturning the award. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy will not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action for judicial relief. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding on all parties, and neither party will have any right to contest or appeal the arbitrator's award. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This provision is self-executing, and in the event that either party fails without good cause to appear at any properly noticed arbitration proceeding absent a previously issued court order. 

(ii) The party who demands arbitration will pay the arbitration filing fee, and each of the parties will advance one-half (1/2) of the fees of the arbitrator. The arbitrator may, in the award, allocate all or part of the costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator and the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the prevailing party incurred in the arbitration. In addition to the foregoing rights and obligations to arbitrate, and without limitation to the powers and authority of the arbitrator appointed and as set forth in the ICC Rules of Arbitration, either party may, without bond, apply ex parte for the entry of emergency equitable relief in accordance with these provisions either before initiating arbitration or during the course of arbitration, including but not limited to provisional equitable relief in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Once such equitable relief has been granted, the parties shall jointly request a stay of the court case pending completion of the arbitration pursuant to these provisions.

(iii) Notwithstanding any choice of law provision herein, all issues relating to arbitration or the enforcement of the within agreement to arbitrate will be governed exclusively by the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The parties will expressly agree not to be bound by any local rules on arbitration, including those relating to the site of arbitration. The Parties hereby appoint the Secretariat of the ICC International Court of Arbitration as their agent for service of process and hereby waive any claim of lack of jurisdiction over such Party or the award. All proceedings shall be undertaken in the English language.

9.4 Compliance: 
You will be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules regulations, order and ordinances of Gibraltar and in any other nation, province, or city with jurisdiction over you or your activities under this Agreement. 

9.5 Severability. 
If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

9.6 Notices. 
You agree that all notices, demands or other correspondence from you related to this Agreement shall be in writing and sent by electronic mail to legal@ivpn.net.

9.7 Waiver and Amendment. 
No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the COMPANY. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement, except as specifically provided herein, shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. Without limiting the foregoing, terms and conditions on any materials submitted by you to COMPANY shall be of no force or effect.

9.8 International Users. 
This Agreement has been written in the English language. You waive any rights that you may have under the laws of your country for this Agreement to be written in the language of that country. 

9.9 Complete Understanding. 
This Agreement constitutes the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written and oral agreements and communications related to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified except pursuant a writing signed by an authorized representative of COMPANY. The parties agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail notwithstanding contrary or additional terms in any purchase order, sales acknowledgment, confirmation or any other document issued by either party. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable then that provision shall be fully severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. COMPANY reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at any time: (i) to modify or discontinue the Software or Documentation; (ii) to limit, terminate or suspend your use of the Software or Documentation; (iii) assess charges for the use of the Software or Documentation in the future; or (iv) to make changes to this Agreement by providing you with the terms to be added or modified and you shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if you choose not to accept those terms, as modified, pursuant to Section 9.7 hereof. Failure of COMPANY to enforce any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of COMPANY's right to enforce each and every term and condition of this Agreement.
