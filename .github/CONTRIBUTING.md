## Pull Requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project.

Follow these steps when you want to submit a pull request:  

1. Go over installation guides in the [README](/README.md#installation)
2. Follow instructions in the [PR Template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
3. Update the [README](/README.md) file with details of changes if applicable

## Git Workflow

This project is using [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

### Branch naming guidelines

Naming for branches is made with following structure:

```
<type>/<issue ID>-<short-summary-or-description>
```

In case when there is no issue:

```
<type>/<short-summary-or-description>
```

Where <type> can be `epic`, `feature`, `task`, `bugfix`, `hotfix` or `release`.

### Branches

`master` - The production branch. Clone or fork this repository for the latest copy.  
`develop` - The active development branch. Pull requests should be directed to this branch.  
`<feature branch>` - The feature of fix branch. Pull requests should be made from this branch into `develop` brach.
